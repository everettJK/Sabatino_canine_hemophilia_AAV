Genome to geome validation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linus chr22-184021 5KB frag 
Clear bridging read pileup with 100 NT deletion.
Clearly full length heavy chain
bridging reads mapped to vector suggest additonal poly-A segment suggesting additional segment.


Linus chr25-34587602
Contig schematics padded by unseen genomic reads.
Bridging reads mapped to vector make sense.
slice13c -- light chain, 5' ITR + 1/4 of promotor. 
slice12b -- light chain, 5' ITR + 1/4 of promotor.


Linus chr37+13443531 
bridging reads mapped to vector make sense.
F8 not seen in contig visualization.
slice14 --  light chain, last 1/4 of F8 + ploy-A + 3' ITR.


M50 chr15-42531469 (X)
no briding reads
slice6-7a -- single chain, 5' ITR + 90% promoter


M50 chr25-34590970
Bridging reads mapped to vector make sense.
Contig visualization needs to be improved.
slice4-5a -- single chain, 5' ITR + promoter + 5% F8
slice2    -- single chain, 5' ITR + promoter + 5% F8; contig visualition suggests inversion of F8
slice1a   -- single chain, 5' ITR + promoter + 5% F8


M50 chr4+14757686
bridging reads not seen leaving promotor in vector alignment.
slice9-10d -- single chain, 5' ITR + 50% promoter
slice8a -- single chain, 5' ITR + 60% promoter



Cetner of F8 -> genome validation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

M50 chr4+14801159
dog1 -- 90% of F8 in single contig; entire vector if we join three contigs. First 1/3 of F8 has weak read coverage. 
dog2 -- weaker result, possible bleed over. Coverage for second half of F8 and 3' ITR

M50 chr4-14757678
dog3 -- all or most of light chain half of the single vector + poly-A + ITR. ! No bridging reads.
dog4 -- all or most of heavy chain half of the single vector + poly-A + ITR. ! No bridging reads. Weak result / bleed over.
dog5 -- all or most of light chain half of the single vector + poly-A + ITR. ! No bridging reads.
dog6 -- all or most of heavy chain half of the single vector + poly-A + ITR. ! No bridging reads. Weak result / bleed over.


J60 chr18-48600092
dog7  -- 3' 1/2 heavy chain + poly-A + ITR; strong 5' bridging read pileup 
dog8  -- 5' 1/2 heavy chain + promotor + ITR; strong 5' (?) bridging read pileup (full heavy chain contig?)
dog9  -- 5' 1/2 heavy chain + promotor + ITR; strong 3' bridging read pileup
dog10 -- lots light chain signal? 5 reads in 3' bridging pileup
dog11 -- 3' 1/2 of light chain. small number bridge reads in both directions.
